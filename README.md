# htool
htool is a media management/gallery application with a focus on simplicity.

## how to use
htool keeps all its data stored in a single sqlite database. when media is imported, the files are copied over to the database without affecting the original files at all. 

in the "importer" tab, you can select a folder to scan for media. most image formats are compatible with htool, and video support is WIP (no audio). when trying to import an archive (`.zip`, `.rar`) or an inner directory, htool will import it as a "pool", keeping all contained media grouped together.

media can be viewed and modified in the "gallery" tab. in a preview window, double click the preview to enter (or exit) fullscreen. while in fullscreen, the hovering/clicking edges of the window perform different actions. the outermost left/right edges of the window will view the next/previous gallery entry. when viewing a pool, the center area of the left/right sides of the window will view the next/previous media entry of that pool. hovering over the bottom of the window will display the page number.
