# htool
htool is a media management/gallery application with a focus on simplicity. 

🚧 htool is still in active development and should not be considered anywhere close to complete. do not use it without other copies of your media or you risk data loss from bugs. 🚧

## how to use
htool keeps all its data stored in a single sqlite database. when media is imported, the files are copied over to the database without affecting the original files at all. 

in the "importer" tab, you can select a folder to scan for media. most image formats are compatible with htool, and video support is WIP (no audio). when trying to import an archive (`.zip`, `.rar`) or an inner directory, htool will import it as a "pool", keeping all contained media grouped together.

media can be viewed and modified in the "gallery" tab. in a preview window, double click the preview to enter (or exit) fullscreen. while in fullscreen, the hovering/clicking edges of the window perform different actions. the outermost left/right edges of the window will view the next/previous gallery entry. when viewing a pool, the center area of the left/right sides of the window will view the next/previous media entry of that pool. hovering over the bottom of the window will display the page number.
